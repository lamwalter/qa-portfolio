Test: BUG-003 — Unlimited login attempts (no rate limit/lockout)
Date: 2025-08-12
Env: Windows 11, Chrome 126 (64-bit)
Target: demo-app/login.html (portfolio demo page; posts to httpbin 200)

Procedure:
- Performed repeated wrong-password attempts using the same valid email.
- DevTools → Network: Preserve log ON, Disable cache ON.

Attempts:
- Total attempts: ~20 within ~3 minutes
- Network results: all responses 200 OK
- No 429 status codes observed
- No rate-limit headers present (e.g., Retry-After, X-RateLimit-*)
- UI message remained: “Email or password is incorrect.”
- No CAPTCHA or lockout banner appeared.

Conclusion:
- No throttling/lockout observed. System allows rapid, unlimited failed attempts → brute-force risk.
