Manual QA test cases and bug reports

## Testing Workflow
- Test cases are created in GitHub as `.md` files.
- Matching Jira issues are created for each test case.
- Commits are linked to Jira using issue keys (e.g., CRM-10).
- Test cases are executed manually, and Actual Result + Status are updated in the file.
- Jira issues are updated with results and moved through the workflow (To Do → In Progress → Done).
